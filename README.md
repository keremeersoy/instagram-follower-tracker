# INSTAGRAM FOLLOWER TRACKER

The purpose of this project is to help people find out who among the accounts they follow on Instagram don't follow them back, without having to provide their Instagram login credentials. To use the tool, all the user needs to do is download the data for the Instagram account they want to check, and upload the JSON files containing only the followers and followings of that account. This way, the tool only accesses the follower and following data, without compromising the user's security by asking for their password.
